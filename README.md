# Software Testing and QA
{Awesome Works in Progress}


## Fundamentals of Testing [(ISTQB)](https://www.istqb.org/certifications/certified-tester-foundation-level)
### What is Software Testing?
`Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or program does what it is supposed to do. The goal is to identify any bugs or issues in the software so they can be fixed before the product is released to users.`
### Why is Testing Necessary?
* Quality Assurance: Ensures the software meets quality standards and user requirements.
* Detects Bugs Early: Identifies problems early in the development cycle, reducing the cost of fixing them.
* Improves User Satisfaction: By ensuring the software works smoothly and as expected, it enhances the user experience.
* Ensures Reliability and Security: Testing checks for reliability, security, and high performance, which are critical for user trust and safety.
* Facilitates Updates and Enhancements: Makes it easier to add new features or make changes without breaking existing functionality.
### Testing Principles
* Testing shows the presence, not the absence of defects.
* Exhaustive testing is impossible.
*  Early testing saves time and money.
*  Defects cluster together.
*  Tests wear out.
*  Testing is context dependent.
*  Absence-of-defects fallacy.
